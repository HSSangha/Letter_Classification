# Letter Classification using different Machine Learning methods

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning is known as the study of algorithms and statistical method that a computing system can use to perform task specific to application without using any instructions, solely relying on patterns and inference. In this module we will learn and understand some of the different methods available in sci-kit learn library. We will focus mainly on classfication methods with some overview of clustering methods.

For demonstrating the appliaction of different methods we will use a data set available on [Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Letter+Recognition) by UCI. 

### Data description

The objective is to identify one of the 26 capital letters in the English alphabet. The alphabet character images were based on 20 different fonts and each letter within these 20 fonts was randomly distorted to produce a file of 20,000 unique stimuli. Each stimulus was converted into 16 primitive numerical attributes (statistical moments and edge counts) which were then scaled to fit into a range of integer values from 0 through 15.

What kind of data is avialble?  How is your data collected?  Are there any concerns about the data?  Which data is the most relevant?  Is the data easy to acccess? Will the data change over time?  What needs to be done to the data to get it ready for any downstream analysis?

### Explore the data

Demonstrate what you would do to describe the data and if it has any patterns or anomolies.  Make some plots.

### Model the data

Build a model, fit the model, validate the model.

### Communciate and visualize the results

What did you learn and do the results make sense?  Revisit your initial question and answer it.  H

### Class Exercise

In each project, I'd like to see a homework assignment that the class can do/evaluate to learn more about your data.  This should be a reproducible notebook that allows them to learn one or more aspects of your data workflow.  It is also an opportunity to share your research with your colleagues.

Here is an example of a fantastic project website:

## Advanced Features

### Stylesheet (Advanced)

If you'd like to add your own custom styles:

1. Create a file called `/assets/css/style.scss` in your site
2. Add the following content to the top of the file, exactly as shown:
    ```scss
    ---
    ---

    @import "{{ site.theme }}";
    ```
3. Add any custom CSS (or Sass, including imports) you'd like immediately after the `@import` line

*Note: If you'd like to change the theme's Sass variables, you must set new values before the `@import` line in your stylesheet.*

### Layouts (Advanced)

If you'd like to change the theme's HTML layout:

1. [Copy the original template](https://github.com/pages-themes/slate/blob/master/_layouts/default.html) from the theme's repository<br />(*Pro-tip: click "raw" to make copying easier*)
2. Create a file called `/_layouts/default.html` in your site
3. Paste the default layout content copied in the first step
4. Customize the layout as you'd like

### Overriding GitHub-generated URLs (Advanced)

Templates often rely on URLs supplied by GitHub such as links to your repository or links to download your project. If you'd like to override one or more default URLs:

1. Look at [the template source](https://github.com/pages-themes/slate/blob/master/_layouts/default.html) to determine the name of the variable. It will be in the form of `{{ site.github.zip_url }}`.
2. Specify the URL that you'd like the template to use in your site's `_config.yml`. For example, if the variable was `site.github.url`, you'd add the following:
    ```yml
    github:
      zip_url: http://example.com/download.zip
      another_url: another value
    ```
3. When your site is built, Jekyll will use the URL you specified, rather than the default one provided by GitHub.

*Note: You must remove the `site.` prefix, and each variable name (after the `github.`) should be indent with two space below `github:`.*

For more information, see [the Jekyll variables documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/variables/).


### Contributing (Advanced)

Interested in contributing to Slate? We'd love your help. Slate is an open source project, built one contribution at a time by users like you. See [the CONTRIBUTING file](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions on how to contribute.

### Previewing the theme locally

If you'd like to preview the theme locally (for example, in the process of proposing a change):

1. Clone down the theme's repository (`git clone https://github.com/pages-themes/slate`)
2. `cd` into the theme's directory
3. Run `script/bootstrap` to install the necessary dependencies
4. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to start the preview server
5. Visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) in your browser to preview the theme

### Running tests

The theme contains a minimal test suite, to ensure a site with the theme would build successfully. To run the tests, simply run `script/cibuild`. You'll need to run `script/bootstrap` one before the test script will work.
